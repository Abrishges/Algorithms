 * Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return the number of paths where the sum of the values along
 *  the path equals targetSum.The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards 
 *  (i.e., traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).
